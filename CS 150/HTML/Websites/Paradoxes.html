		<h1>Paradoxes</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Russell's Paradox</a></h2>
		<p>The Twentieth Century Logician Bertrand Russell 
		introduced a curious paradox: <b style="color: red;">This statement is 
		false.</b> The statement can't be true, because it 
		claims the converse; however, if it is not true, then it's 
		false, just as it says.  That makes it true.  Paradoxically, 
		it seems to be neither true or false, or perhaps both 
		true and false.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte">Margritte's Paradox</a></h2>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images"><img src="pipe.jpg" alt="pip picture" width="250" style="float:right"/></a>
		<p>The famous Belgian artist Ren&eacute; Magritte 
		rendered the idea of Russell's Paradox visually in his 
		famous painting <i>Ceci n'est pas une pipe</i>.  The  
		title translates from French,  This Is Not A Pipe.  The 
		painting shows a pipe with the text <i>Ceci n'est pas 
		une pipe</i> below it.  Superficially, the painting looks 
		like  a true statement, since it is a <i>picture</i> of 
		the pipe, not an actual pipe; however, the assertion is 
		also part of the picture, which seems to make it false, 
		because it is clearly a painting of a pipe. Paradoxically, 
		the truth seems to depend on whether the statement is 
		an assertion about the painging or a part of it - but, it is both!</p>
