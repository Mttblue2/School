	<h2>Why I'm interested in CS</h2>
	<p>I am interested in Computer Science because doing things with computers has always interested. As far back as
	I remember I have always tinkering with computers, taking them apart, building them out of salvaged parts and
	figuring out just how they work. I even tried teaching myself C++ while in middle school. It is something I really
	enjoy and am always trying to further my knowledge of computers.</p>
	<h2>My favorite musical groups</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Fallout Boy</li>
		<li>The Script</li>
		<li>The All-American Rejects</li>
		<li>Red Hot Chili Peppers</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>My hobbies</h2>
	<p>Most of my hobbies include things around computers. I'm the one everybody comes to to fix their computer. 
	So I'm constantly salvaging parts from old computers and fixing other ones. Another one of my hobbies is woodworking.
	My grandfather had a woodworking shop with everything you could think of to make anything. He past away in March and 
	since then, its been closed up and not used. So I decided I wanted to learn it to and now build things and learn
	how to woodwork during the weekend.</p>
